                        A <i>binary gap</i> within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary representation of N.

                    <p>
                        For example, number 9 has binary representation
                        <tt style="white-space: pre-wrap">1001</tt> and contains a binary gap of length 2. The number 529 has binary representation
                        <tt style="white-space: pre-wrap">1000010001</tt> and contains two binary gaps: one of length 4 and one of length 3. The number 20 has binary representation
                        <tt style="white-space: pre-wrap">10100</tt> and contains one binary gap of length 1. The number 15 has binary representation
                        <tt style="white-space: pre-wrap">1111</tt> and has no binary gaps. The number 32 has binary representation
                        <tt style="white-space: pre-wrap">100000</tt> and has no binary gaps.
                    </p>
                    <p>Write a function:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p style="
                font-family: monospace;
                font-size: 9pt;
                display: block;
                white-space: pre-wrap;
              ">
                            <tt>class Solution { public int solution(int N); }</tt>
                        </p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        that, given a positive integer N, returns the length of its longest binary gap. The function should return 0 if N doesn't contain a binary gap.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, given N = 1041 the function should return 5, because N has binary representation
                        <tt style="white-space: pre-wrap">10000010001</tt> and so its longest binary gap is of length 5. Given N = 32 the function should return 0, because N has binary representation '100000' and thus no binary gaps.
                    </p>
                    <p>
